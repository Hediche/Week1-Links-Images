    <p><b>  learned how to code when I was at University, at the time, 
        I learned Visual Basic to creat apps. but now VB is no longer 
        applicable or I have never heard of it anywhere else over the 
        years. later, in my master study I studied Perl for Bioinformatics.
        During my research assistant job, I had to work with R programming 
        language, then Matlab and Python afterwards. These all made me very 
        interested in coding again, especially, designing web applications. 
        So I followed Udemy course, and now here I am, following FD training 
        course opened by Brainnest. I am so excited that I am here to gain team work 
        experiences.</b>
